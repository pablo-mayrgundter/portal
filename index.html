Soliton a next generation business
- .live, .media, .partners
- To help group minds function
    - Based on my theories of AI
- Distributed business model
    - Looking for the benevolent and charming futurists of the world

soliton.gallery
- Exo Cafe is a participatory art community built on Cloud City
- Cloud City is really a Technology Showcase as a Platform (TSaaP ;) trying to glean where we’re going in the future.
    - cosmic.js - Library for Cosmography, to know where we are in the cosmos (spacetime soliton)
        - orbit.js plugin, a refactor from Celestiary (someone must already have this)
        - Plugins for: relativistic coordinates, Wolfram branchial coordinates, Weinstein gauge symmetry shit
    - Celestiary layer for stargazing
    - Revive NetMap(&WebMap?) publicly, on Cosmograph for GeoNetMap
    - nsync.us Synchronizer web app multi-channel frontend to murmur server.  Run on gcloud, but also have a wizard for users to pick their best geo layout (displayed with NetMap), for lowest latency of the murmur server for a set of players.  The Synch Master should deploy instances eg of murmur docker images, on demand, and reuse them as a shared backend for all users.  e.g. run a murmur docker instance per “Room” of a user group, and have multiple severs/rooms per docker container.  Other local resources could go in here, like Matrix chat client!  That way all metadata is distributed over Matrix.  Just throw in Blockchain or Bitcoin FTW! ;)  Someone’s already thinking about blockchain on matrix.
    - soliton-ai.js - study library for my thesis
        - Systems of ODEs related to solitonic physics, e.g. standing magnetic fields
        - Cyclical neural net solver
        - 3D display as GPU/TPU code for realtime simulation
            - Should be able to literally render/display the internal reflection of the outside world on a sample plane in the render field
        - Use librr and Physicell to simulate
    - Multi-person presence chat on top of Synchronizer with Max Pablo
    - exo.cafe, the first live instance of Cloud City
        - Max Pablo bartending
        - Building is a PCB/Wafer schematic, laid out in cosmic.js, in a corner of Pablo’s CPU
            - The projection algorithm is interesting.  I suppose it could use some weighted function of where on the CPU certain types of calculations happen, or maybe hover over the CPU or have projection lines bak to the RAM wafers where data is stored.
                - But further in the future, actually visually recapitulate solitonic hardware
    - Cloud Cities are cloud regions where Synchronizer is deployed.
        - You usually have to travel (portal) between them.
        - They’re usually based on real clusters of people, shown on the GeoNetMap layer.
        - THIS IS TO HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE NET
 “Also, on "give data" vs "contributing data", our protocols have withered as the giant walled gardens took over.  We need more decentralized approaches again. I agree the need is there address how data is created and managed, but also that the language is rightly shifting to reflect change of subject from corporate to participant/community ownership.  From User Generated Content to Participant Built Community.“
